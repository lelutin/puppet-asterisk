; Logging Configuration
;
; In this file, you configure logging to files or to
; the syslog system.
;
; "logger reload" at the CLI will reload configuration
; of the logging system.

[general]
;
; Customize the display of debug message time stamps
; this example is the ISO 8601 date format (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS)
;
; see strftime(3) Linux manual for format specifiers.  Note that there is also
; a fractional second parameter which may be used in this field.  Use %1q
; for tenths, %2q for hundredths, etc.
;
;dateformat=%F %T       ; ISO 8601 date format
;dateformat=%F %T.%3q   ; with milliseconds
;
;
; This makes Asterisk write callids to log messages
; (defaults to yes)
;use_callids = no
;
; This appends the hostname to the name of the log files.
;appendhostname = yes
;
; This determines whether or not we log queue events to a file
; (defaults to yes).
;queue_log = no
;
; Determines whether the queue_log always goes to a file, even
; when a realtime backend is present (defaults to no).
;queue_log_to_file = yes
;
; Set the queue_log filename
; (defaults to queue_log)
;queue_log_name = queue_log

; When using realtime for the queue log, use GMT for the timestamp
; instead of localtime.  (defaults to no)
;queue_log_realtime_use_gmt = no

; Log rotation strategy (defaults to sequential):
; none:  Do not perform any log rotation at all.  You should make
;        very sure to set up some external log rotate mechanism
;        as the asterisk logs can get very large, very quickly.
; sequential:  Rename archived logs in order, such that the newest
;              has the highest sequence number.  When
;              exec_after_rotate is set, ${filename} will specify
;              the new archived logfile.
; rotate:  Rotate all the old files, such that the oldest has the
;          highest sequence number [this is the expected behavior
;          for Unix administrators].  When exec_after_rotate is
;          set, ${filename} will specify the original root filename.
; timestamp:  Rename the logfiles using a timestamp instead of a
;             sequence number when "logger rotate" is executed.
;             When exec_after_rotate is set, ${filename} will
;             specify the new archived logfile.
;rotatestrategy = rotate
;
; Run a system command after rotating the files.  This is mainly
; useful for rotatestrategy=rotate. The example allows the last
; two archive files to remain uncompressed, but after that point,
; they are compressed on disk.
;
; exec_after_rotate=gzip -9 ${filename}.2
;
;
[logfiles]
; For each file, specify what to log.
;
; For console logging, you set options at start of
; Asterisk with -v for verbose and -d for debug
; See 'asterisk -h' for more information.
;
; Directory for log files is configures in asterisk.conf
; option astlogdir
;
; File names can either be relative to the standard Asterisk log directory (see "astlogdir" in
; asterisk.conf), or absolute paths that begin with '/'.
;
; A few file names have been reserved and are considered special, thus cannot be used and will
; not be considered as a regular file name.  These include the following:
;
;    syslog - logs to syslog facility
;    console - logs messages to the Asterisk root console.
;
; Format is "filename" and then "levels" of debugging to be included.
; For each file name given a comma separated list of logging "level" types should be specified
; and include at least one of the following (in no particular order):
;    debug
;    notice
;    warning
;    error
;    verbose(<level>)
;    dtmf
;    fax
;    security
;
; The "verbose" value can take an optional integer argument that indicates the maximum level
; of verbosity to log at.  Verbose messages with higher levels than the indicated level will
; not be logged to the file.  If a verbose level is not given, verbose messages are logged
; based upon the current level set for the root console.

; Special filename "console" represents the root console
;
;
; Verbose takes an optional argument, in the form of an integer level.
; Verbose messages with higher levels will not be logged to the file.  If
; the verbose level is not specified, it will log verbose messages following
; the current level of the root console.
;
; The special character "*" can also be specified and represents all levels, even dynamic
; levels registered by modules after the logger has been initialized.  This means that loading
; and unloading modules that create and remove dynamic logging levels will result in these
; levels being included on filenames that have a level name of "*", without any need to
; perform a "logger reload" or similar operation.
;
; Special level name "*" means all levels, even dynamic levels registered
; by modules after the logger has been initialized (this means that loading
; and unloading modules that create/remove dynamic logger levels will result
; in these levels being included on filenames that have a level name of "*",
; without any need to perform a 'logger reload' or similar operation).
; Note that there is no value in specifying both "*" and specific level names
; for a filename; the "*" level means all levels.  The only exception is if
; you need to specify a specific verbose level. e.g, "verbose(3),*".
;
; Note, there is no value in specifying both "*" and specific level types for a file name.
; The "*" level means ALL levels.  The only exception is if you need to specify a specific
; verbose level. e.g, "verbose(3),*".
;
; We highly recommend that you DO NOT turn on debug mode if you are simply
; running a production system.  Debug mode turns on a LOT of extra messages,
; most of which you are unlikely to understand without an understanding of
; the underlying code.  Do NOT report debug messages as code issues, unless
; you have a specific issue that you are attempting to debug.  They are
; messages for just that -- debugging -- and do not rise to the level of
; something that merit your attention as an Asterisk administrator.  Debug
; messages are also very verbose and can and do fill up logfiles quickly;
; this is another reason not to have debug mode on a production system unless
; you are in the process of debugging a specific issue.
