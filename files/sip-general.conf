; If regcontext is specified, Asterisk will dynamically create and destroy a

; us.  The actual extension is the 'regexten' parameter of the registering

; be supplied if they are separated by '&'.  Patterns may be used in regexten.

;
; Asterisk can register as a SIP user agent to a SIP proxy (provider)
; Format for the register statement is:
;       register => user[:secret[:authuser]]@host[:port][/extension]
;
; If no extension is given, the 's' extension is used. The extension needs to
; be defined in extensions.conf to be able to accept calls from this SIP proxy
; (provider).
;
; host is either a host name defined in DNS or the name of a section defined
; below.
;
; Examples:
;
;register => 1234:password@mysipprovider.com
;
;     This will pass incoming calls to the 's' extension
;
;
;register => 2345:password@sip_proxy/1234
;
;    Register 2345 at sip provider 'sip_proxy'.  Calls from this provider
;    connect to local extension 1234 in extensions.conf, default context,
;    unless you configure a [sip_proxy] section below, and configure a
;    context.
;    Tip 1: Avoid assigning hostname to a sip.conf section like [provider.com]
;    Tip 2: Use separate type=peer and type=user sections for SIP providers
;           (instead of type=friend) if you have calls in both directions

; The nat= setting is used when Asterisk is on a public IP, communicating with
; devices hidden behind a NAT device (broadband router).  If you have one-way
; audio problems, you usually have problems with your NAT configuration or your
